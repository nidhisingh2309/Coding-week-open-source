Hello there! 
I am Nidhi Singh from Gorakhpur ,Uttar Pradesh. I am passionate for learning new things and exploring
various domains. I have keen interest in reading books and quite much in coding(although I am not
so good and need to learn a lot!).  
I want to contribute to open source because that is what let you learn by looking into other people mistakes, what are the best domains of interest for you and how to work efficiently in a team and to learn from others. Moreover, it gives us a better idea of what is into the real world.
